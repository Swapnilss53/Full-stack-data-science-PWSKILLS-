The time complexity of each code block:

### Problem 1: Quicksort
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) on average
  - The partitioning step takes O(n) time, and the recursive calls are made on two halves.
  - In the worst case, it can be O(n^2) if the pivot choice consistently creates imbalanced partitions.

### Problem 2: Nested Loop Example
- **Time Complexity:** O(rows * cols)
  - The function iterates through each element of the matrix once.
  - Assuming the matrix is rectangular (rows Ã— cols).

### Problem 3: Example Function
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - The function iterates through each element in the array once.

### Problem 4: Longest Increasing Subsequence
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
  - The nested loops iterate through all pairs of elements in the array.

### Problem 5: Mysterious Function
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
  - The function has nested loops that iterate through all pairs of elements in the array.

### Problem 6: Sum of Digits (Recursive)
- **Time Complexity:** O(log10(n))
  - The recursive function divides the number by 10 in each call.

### Problem 7: Fibonacci Series (Recursive)
- **Time Complexity:** O(2^n)
  - The naive recursive Fibonacci function has exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations.

### Problem 8: Subset Sum (Recursive)
- **Time Complexity:** O(2^n)
  - The recursive solution explores all possible subsets.

### Problem 9: Word Break (Recursive)
- **Time Complexity:** Exponential
  - The recursive solution explores all possible segmentations.

### Problem 10: N-Queens (Recursive)
- **Time Complexity:** Exponential
  - The recursive solution explores all possible queen placements.
