    "data, where the number of features is large relative to the number of observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This capability makes them well-suited for applications like text classification and bioinformatics.\n",

    "2. Robust to Overfitting: By focusing on maximizing the margin between classes, SVMs are less \n",
    "prone to overfitting compared to algorithms that do not explicitly incorporate regularization. \n",
    "\n",
    "This property is especially beneficial when working with complex data or datasets with noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Versatility with Kernels: SVMs can handle non-linearly separable data through the use of kernel \n",

    "higher-dimensional space. \n",
    "\n",
    "This versatility makes SVMs adaptable to a wide range of problems with varying data distributions.\n",

    "A larger margin often leads to better generalization on unseen data, as it ensures a more robust \n",

    "vectors, which are the most informative data points for the classification task. \n",
    "This clarity helps in understanding the model's decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Well-Defined Optimization Problem: The SVM formulation leads to a convex optimization problem, \n",
